Chad is a cancer biologist that works heavily on performing and analysing RNA-seq experiments. 
Brad is a scientist interested in analysing RNA-seq data for the first time. 

Chad and Brad will load in their raw RNA-seq data. Next, they will load in scores from gene2vec. Fianlly, they will classify individual single cells and vizualize the results using UMAP.

Using these celltype-gene word associations, both Brad and Chad will integrate biological domain knowledge and data-driven discovery to identify new cell-types.
